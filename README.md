# Data Structures and Algorithms Problems
I implemented the following abstract data types:
* Collection (bag) - using a dynamic array
* Multidictionary - using a linked list
* Ordered multidictionary - using a binary search tree
* Matrix - using a hashtable (Coalesced chaining)
* List - using a linked list (with array chaining)

I also wrote an app that merges N ordered vectors using an implemented generic heap (using c++ templates).

## What I Learned
* A deeper understanding of data structures an abstract data types
* Learned better code complexity analysis
* How to choose more easily what data structure is good for the case in hand
* The upsides and downsides of each data structure
* The basiscs of writing an API
